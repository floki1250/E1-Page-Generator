Version 5.0.0
 * Look and feel updates to match Alta/FUSE+ styling (TR 9.1.5)

Version 4.1.2
 * Fixed a bug (19403980) where some long tile titles were being truncated.

Version 4.1.1
 * Fixed a bug in which, whenever a watchlist tile was assigned a custom icon,
   all watchlists on the page would become non-functional.  Henceforth, 
   assigning a custom icon to a watchlist should work as intended and not break
   all watchlists.

Version 4.1.0
 * Added support for Watchlist type of  tiles and a Watchlist component.  The 
   generator will add the right code for a watchlist=<watchlistId> as a tile
   and also put a watchlist component place holder for *watchlistcomponent=left
   global setting (Only supporting the left side placement right now).

Version 4.0.1
 * Removed the need to escape the ('\') the pipe ('|') in the .dat file and 
   requested that the Generator document be updated to reflect that the
   pipe character needs to be escaped if the user wants to see it on the page 
   or it's required in any of the java script calls like it is for the runE1App
   call when the form DS values are being passed. 

Version 4.0
 * E1Pages made using version 4.0 and later of the generator require Tools
   Release 9.1.2 or later to run properly.  
 * Added support for task-based item definitions.  Rather than supplying 
   app, form, version, textual name, etc., the user can now simply type:
     @A:task=3/G01
   At runtime within the jas server, the JAS server will fill in the 
   remaining information, including the task name, the icon, and the 
   javascript to execute the task.  The JAS server will also disable the
   item if the user does not have security to run target app/report for 
   the task.  See example 20.
     * If a task has a F9002 record providing a translated name, that name
       will be used for the task when viewed by users of that language.
     * Any task-type that is supported on the web (e.g., from the fastpath)
       is supported EXCEPT for folders.  
     * If a user defines an item to be a non-existant task or a task that
       is not a valid type, the rendered page in JAS will show a broken
       item with a description of the error.
     * If the user wants to override the default icon and/or name for
       a task-based item, the user may.  (A user may not override the
       javascript action to run the task, nor may the user create a 
       tooltip that incorrectly identifies the app/form/version.)
     * Going forward, using task-based items is preferred whenever possible.
 * Added a global option *hideSecurityBlockedItems.  When this option is
   present, items that are blocked by security will be completely invisible.
   (The default behavior is for them to be disabled.)
 * All of the example dat files were moved to a subdirectory within dat_files
   called examples.  
 * Fixed a bug where all disabled tiles were blue.  Disabled items that have
   a color override (red, green, or yellow) will now correctly honor that 
   override in flowStyle=tiles as they already did in other flowstyles.
 * Generated pages will now be accessible for screen readers.
 * Fixed a bug to allow comment lines (lines beginning with a pund (#) sign)
   to be properly ignored.  
      
Version 3.1
 * Added support for linux/unix.  Simply run generatePages.sh instead of
   generatePages.bat.
 * Added reference directory, containing this changelog and a copy of 
   e1pagehelper.js for reference as to which javascript API's are available.
 * Added the ability to add left-facing arrows.  (See ex19_leftArrows.dat)
 * Fixed a bug in the placement of hover tooltips on pages that are tall 
   enough to require a scrollbar.  
 * Added the ability to specify customIcon=none on a particular item to have
   just that item have no icon.
 * Fixed bug in the placement of the page title for RTL mode.  (Needed some
   padding on the right edge so it isn't flush against edge of the window.)
 * Fixed bug in the placement of the expand/collapse control for RTL mode.
   (Moved from left to right.)
